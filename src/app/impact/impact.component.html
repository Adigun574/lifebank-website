        <h1>Lives Saved</h1>
        <p>Since we launched in 2016, we have rescued over 9,000 people and counting. Everyday when we go to work, our job is saving the lives of women in childbirth, children with malaria and or pneumonia, and people with chronic and emergency conditions. Our goal is to grow the number of lives we’ve touched exponentially and across Africa.</p>

        <h1>Communities Helped</h1>
        <p>We believe in the universal access to healthcare. We believe healthcare is a human right and poverty should not be a barrier to healthcare access. Thus, we work to ensure all communities, no matter how poor, have access to critical supplies. Our BOAT by LifeBank platform provides deeply subsidized, or absolutely free access to blood and oxygen across 5 states in Nigeria, and Kenya. BOAT by LifeBank is a trust and a foundation that funds the procurement of blood and oxygen to poor and vulnerable Nigerians and Kenyans. We work with doctors to identify low-income patients in need. The foundation has helped 423 patients in the first season. Season 2’s goal is to raise 10 million naira for 3,500 patients. Join Us.</p>

        <h1>Jobs Created</h1>
        <p>Poverty is a human rights issue and jobs are a path to reducing poverty. We work with local communities to provide training and experience to vulnerable citizens thereby improving their livelihoods. We improve prosperity for our communities by creating expertise in our blood riders, moving them from Okada (bike) guys, to Expert Medical Dispatch Riders with better pay and job satisfaction.</p>
