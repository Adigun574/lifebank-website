      <h1> Join us and save the world!</h1>
      <p>
        Night gathers, and now my watch begins. It shall not end until my death. I shall take no wife, hold no lands, father no children. I shall wear no crowns and win no glory. I shall live and die at my post. I am the sword in the darkness. I am the watcher on the walls. I am the fire that burns against the cold, the light that brings the dawn, the horn that wakes the sleepers, the shield that guards the realms of men. I pledge my life and honor to be a LifeBanker. The LifeBank Night's Watch Oath!
      </p>
      <p>We are LifeBankers - Our community is diverse, reflective of a dynamic atmosphere that welcomes everyone and asks that you bring your real self to work. We are keen on making a difference across our continent. With your ingenuity and hard work, we can rescue our people and build the infrastructure for healthcare in Africa. </p>
